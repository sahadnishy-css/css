Create a simple "Team Profile web page" for a fictional company. The page should show:
A main heading and a subheading.
A quote about teamwork.
A team photo styled as a circle and centered.
A table listing 3 employees with their names, roles, and status.
The table should show one active, one on leave, and one resigned employee, using color indicators.
A warning alert should appear if any employee is not currently active.
Make it look professional and responsive using Bootstrap
